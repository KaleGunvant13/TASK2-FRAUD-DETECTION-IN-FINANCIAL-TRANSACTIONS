**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to employ various machine learning techniques for credit card fraud detection in online transactions. Financial fraud poses a significant threat to the financial industry, and credit card fraud detection is particularly challenging due to the dynamic nature of both fraudulent and normal behaviors, along with highly skewed datasets. The project aims to address these challenges and enhance fraud detection performance by:

1. **Exploring Machine Learning Techniques:**
   - Investigating the application of diverse machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosted Tree.

2. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Building predictive models to assess the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

3. **Adaptability to Changing Behaviors:**
   - Addressing the challenge of changing profiles in both fraudulent and normal behaviors over time.

4. **Handling Skewed Data Sets:**
   - Developing strategies to mitigate the impact of highly skewed datasets on the accuracy of fraud detection.

5. **Variable Selection Impact:**
   - Evaluating the influence of different variables on the performance of fraud detection models.

6. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Conducting a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosted Tree in the context of credit card fraud detection.

7. **Improving Detection Accuracy:**
   - Striving to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection through the exploration and application of various machine learning methodologies.

8. **Contributing to Fraud Prevention:**
   - Providing insights and recommendations for improving fraud prevention measures within the financial industry based on the findings and performance metrics of the implemented machine learning models.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat financial fraud and bolster the security of online transactions within the financial sector.
